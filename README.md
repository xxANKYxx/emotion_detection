2-Untitiled.py is jupyter notebook consists of image preprocessing and model creation
  model is trained and then saved as my_model to avoid training model again and again
   my_model is model trained and saved
  
  
3-haarcascade_frontalface_default is a classifier used to detect faces through webcam 

4-my_model_weights is weights of my keras model(it can be used to load weights in your model)
